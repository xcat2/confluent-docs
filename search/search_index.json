See information on net.switch for more on the flexibility of net.* attributes.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>net.team_mode</code>:   Indicates that this interface should be a team and what mode or runner to use when teamed. If this covers a deployment interface, one of the member interfaces may be brought up as a standalone interface until deployment is complete, as supported by the OS deployment profile.

Within <code>{}</code> are a number of potential substitute values and operations.</p> <p>Note that syntax of expressions can have overlap with the shell syntax. For example:</p> <p><code>$ echo (n2)</code> <code>-bash: syntax error near unexpected token</code>n2'`  </p> <p>In such a case, it helps to quote the expression to allow it to be passed:</p> <p><code>$ echo '(n2)'</code> <code>(n2)</code> </p> <p>The most common operation is to extract a number from the nodename. These  values are available as n1, n2, etc. So for example attributes for a node named  b1o2r3u4 would have {n1} as 1, {n2} as 2, {n3} as 3, and {n4} as 4.  Additionally, {n0} is special as representing the last number in a name, so in the b1o2r3u4 example, {n0} would be 4.</p> <p>Frequently a value derives from a number in the node name, but must undergo a transform to be useful. As an example, if we have a scheme where nodes are numbered n1-n512, and they are arranged 1-42 in rack1, 43-84 in rack2, and so forth, it is convenient to perform arithmetic on the extracted number. Here is an example of codifying the above scheme, and setting the u to the remainder:</p> <p><code>location.rack=rack{(n1-1)/42+1}</code> <code>location.u={(n1-1)%42+1}</code> </p> <p>Note how text may be mixed into expressions, only data within {} will receive special treatment. Here we also had to adjust by subtracting 1 and adding it back to make the math work as expected.</p> <p>It is sometimes the case that the number must be formatted a different way, either specifying 0 padding or converting to hexadecimal. This can be done by a number of operators at the end to indicate formatting changes.</p> <p><code>{n1:02x} - Zero pad to two decimal places, and convert to hexadecimal, as mightbe used for generating MAC addresses</code> <code>{n1:x} - Hexadecimal without padding, as may be used in a generated IPv6 address</code> <code>{n1:X} - Uppercase hexadecimal</code> <code>{n1:02d} - Zero pad a normal numeric representation of the number.</code> </p> <p>Another common element to pull into an expression is the node name in whole:</p> <p><code>hardwaremanagement.manager={node}-imm</code></p> <p>Additionally other attributes may be pulled in:</p> <p><code>hardwaremanagement.switchport={location.u}</code> </p> <p>Multiple expressions are permissible within a single attribute:</p> <p><code>hardwaremanagement.manager={node}-{hardwaremanagement.method}</code></p> <p>A note to developers: in general the API layer will automatically recognize a generic set attribute to string with expression syntax and import it as an expression. For example, submitting the following JSON:</p> <p><code>{ 'location.rack': '{n1}' }</code></p> <p>Will auto-detect {n1} as an expression and assign it normally.

Can be a comma delimited list to indicate aliases</p> </li> <li> <p><code>net.hwaddr</code>:   The hardware address, aka MAC address of the interface indicated, generally populated by the PXE discovery mechanism</p> </li> <li> <p><code>net.interface_names</code>:   Interface name or comma delimited list of names to match for this interface. It is generally recommended to leave this blank unless needing to set up interfaces that are not on a common subnet with a confluent server, as confluent servers provide autodetection for matching the correct network definition to an interface. This would be the default name per the deployed OS and can be a comma delimited list to denote members of a team or a single interface for VLAN/PKEY connections.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>net.ipv4_address</code>:   When configuring static, use this address.  If unspecified, it will check if the node name resolves to an IP address.  Additionally, the subnet prefix may be specified with a suffix, e.g. \"/16\".  If not specified, it will attempt to autodetect based on current network configuration.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>net.ipv4_gateway</code>:   The IPv4 gateway to use if applicable.  As is the case for other net attributes, net.eth0.ipv4_gateway and similar is accepted.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>net.ipv4_method</code>:   Whether to use static or dhcp when configuring this interface for IPv4. \"firmwaredhcp\" means to defer to external DHCP server during firmware execution, but use static for OS. \"firmwarenone\" means to suppress even the no-IP dhcp offers, to fully delegate to an external dhcp/pxe configuration, even for confluent deployment.</p> <p>Valid values: 'dhcp', 'static', 'firmwaredhcp', 'firmwarenone', 'none'</p> </li> <li> <p><code>net.ipv6_address</code>:   When configuring static, use this address.  If unspecified, it will check if the node name resolves to an IP address.  Additionally, the subnet prefix may be specified with a suffix, e.g. \"/64\".  If not specified, it will attempt to autodetect based on current network configuration.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>net.ipv6_gateway</code>:   The IPv6 gateway to use if applicable.  As is the case for other net attributes, net.eth0.ipv6_gateway and similar is accepted.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>net.ipv6_method</code>:   Whether to use static or dhcp when configuring this interface for IPv6. \"firmwaredhcp\" means to defer to external DHCP server during firmware execution, but use static for OS. \"firmwarenone\" means to suppress even the no-IP dhcp offers, to fully delegate to an external dhcp/pxe configuration, even for confluent deployment</p> <p>Valid values: 'dhcp', 'static', 'firmwaredhcp', 'firmwarenone', 'none'</p> </li> <li> <p><code>net.mtu</code>:   MTU to apply to this connection</p> </li> <li> <p><code>net.switch</code>:   An ethernet switch the node is connected to.  Note that net.* attributes may be indexed by interface. For example instead of using net.switch, it is possible to use net.eth0.switch and net.eth1.switch or net.0.switch and net.1.switch to define multiple sets of net connectivity associated with each other.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>net.switchport</code>:   The port on the switch that corresponds to this node. See information on net.switch for more on the flexibility of net.* attributes.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>net.team_mode</code>:   Indicates that this interface should be a team and what mode or runner to use when teamed. If this covers a deployment interface, one of the member interfaces may be brought up as a standalone interface until deployment is complete, as supported by the OS deployment profile. To support this scenario, the switch should be set up to allow independent operation of member ports (e.g. lacp bypass mode or fallback mode).</p> <p>Valid values: 'lacp', 'loadbalance', 'roundrobin', 'activebackup', 'none'</p> </li> <li> <p><code>net.vlan_id</code>:   Ethernet VLAN or InfiniBand PKEY to use for this connection. Specify the parent device using net.interface_names.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>ntp.servers</code>:   NTP server or servers to provide to node during deployment. An OS profile may default to internet NTP, depending on default configuration of the respective operating system</p> </li> <li> <p><code>power.outlet</code>:   Species the outlet identifier on the PDU associoted with a power input on the node</p> </li> <li> <p><code>power.pdu</code>:   Specifies the managed PDU associated with a power input on the node</p> </li> <li> <p><code>pubkeys.addpolicy</code>:   Policy to use when encountering unknown public keys.  Choices are \"automatic\" to accept and store new key if no key known and \"manual\" to always reject a new key, even if no key knownNote that if the trusted CA verifies the certificate, that is accepted ignoring this policy.  Default policy is \"automatic\"</p> <p>Valid values: 'automatic', 'manual'</p> </li> <li> <p><code>pubkeys.ssh</code>:   Fingerprint of the SSH key of the OS running on the system.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>pubkeys.tls</code>:   Fingerprint of the TLS certificate for service running on host.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>pubkeys.tls_hardwaremanager</code>:   Fingerprint of the TLS certificate recognized asbelonging to the hardware manager of the server</p> </li> <li> <p><code>secret.hardwaremanagementpassword</code>:   Password to use when connecting to the hardware manager.  Aliases for this attribute include bmcpass and switchpass</p> </li> <li> <p><code>secret.hardwaremanagementuser</code>:   The username to use when connecting to the hardware manager. Aliases for this attribute include bmcuser and switchuser</p> </li> <li> <p><code>secret.ipmikg</code>:   Optional Integrity key for IPMI communication.  This should generally be ignored, as mutual authentication is normally done with the password alone (which is a shared secret in IPMI)</p> </li> <li> <p><code>secret.selfapiarmtoken</code>:   A one-time use shared secret to authenticate a node api token</p> </li> <li> <p><code>secret.snmpcommunity</code>:   SNMPv1 community string, it is highly recommended tostep up to SNMPv3</p> </li> <li> <p><code>ssh.trustnodes</code>:   Nodes that are allowed to ssh into the node, expressed in noderange syntax.

This should enable SNI to select the correct certificate given the context allowing both use cases to proceed.</p> <ul> <li>Using the custom CA to issue a confluent friendly certificate.</li> </ul> <p>In addition to the names desired, you may wish to add the IP addresses as subject alternative names to the certificate.  If this is possible, then confluent should be able to proceed as nomal.  However, this may be onerous at best (having to redo the certificate process with your organization for an ip address change) or impossible at worst (a common policy is to forbid IP address based SAN entries).</p>"},{"location":"miscellaneous/xccdeployment/","title":"Deploying servers using the xClarity Controller","text":"<p>This procedure will leverage the Virtual USB function on appropriately licensed xClarity Controllers to aid in deployment, which is particularly useful when doing deployment over a routed network with minimal external configuration.</p>"},{"location":"miscellaneous/xccdeployment/#ensure-net-attributes-contain-the-networking-configuration","title":"Ensure net attributes contain the networking configuration","text":"<p>For static IP deployments, it is important that confluent be given the prefix length and the gateway.</p> <pre><code># nodeattrib d1 net.ipv4_address=192.168.16.35/24 net.ipv4_gateway=192.168.16.254\nd1: 192.168.16.35/24\nd1: 192.168.16.254\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"miscellaneous/xccdeployment/#set-the-desired-profile-to-be-pending","title":"Set the desired profile to be pending","text":"<pre><code># nodeattrib d1-d4 deployment.pendingprofile=rocky-8.7-x86_64-default\nd1: rocky-8.7-x86_64-default\nd2: rocky-8.7-x86_64-default\nd3: rocky-8.7-x86_64-default\nd4: rocky-8.7-x86_64-default\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"miscellaneous/xccdeployment/#create-an-identity-image","title":"Create an identity image","text":"<p>The identity image contains credentials, network configuration, and information about the deployment server.</p> <pre><code># confetty set /noderange/d1-d4/deployment/ident_image=create\ncreated: nodes/d2/deployment/ident_image\ncreated: nodes/d4/deployment/ident_image\ncreated: nodes/d3/deployment/ident_image\ncreated: nodes/d1/deployment/ident_image\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"miscellaneous/xccdeployment/#upload-the-identity-image-to-the-xclarity-controller","title":"Upload the identity image to the xClarity Controller","text":"<pre><code># noderun d1-d4 nodemedia {node} upload /var/lib/confluent/private/identity_images/{node}.img\nd1: d1: initializing:   0%\nd2: d2: initializing:   0%\nd4: d4: initializing:   0%\nd3: d3: initializing:   0%\nd1: d1: upload: 100%\nd2: d2: upload: 100%\nd4: d4: upload: 100%\nd3: d3: upload: 100%\nd4: d4: complete: 100%\nd3: d3: complete: 100%\nd1: d1: complete: 100%\nd2: d2: complete: 100%\nd4: d4: d4.img\nd3: d3: d3.img\nd2: d2: d2.img\nd1: d1: d1.img\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"miscellaneous/xccdeployment/#attach-the-boot-image-for-the-desired-profile","title":"Attach the boot image for the desired profile","text":"<pre><code># nodemedia d1-d4 attach http://172.30.1.5/confluent-public/os/rocky-8.7-x86_64-default/boot.img\nd1: http://172.30.1.5/confluent-public/os/rocky-8.7-x86_64-default/boot.img (insecure)\nd1: d1.img\nd2: http://172.30.1.5/confluent-public/os/rocky-8.7-x86_64-default/boot.img (insecure)\nd2: d2.img\nd3: http://172.30.1.5/confluent-public/os/rocky-8.7-x86_64-default/boot.img (insecure)\nd3: d3.img\nd4: http://172.30.1.5/confluent-public/os/rocky-8.7-x86_64-default/boot.img (insecure)\nd4: d4.img\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"miscellaneous/xccdeployment/#boot-nodes-to-usb-to-commence-deployment","title":"Boot nodes to usb to commence deployment","text":"<pre><code># nodeboot d1-d usb\nd1: usb\nd1: reset\nd2: usb\nd2: reset\nd3: usb\nd3: reset\nd4: usb\nd4: reset\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"miscellaneous/xccdeployment/#deployment-should-proceed-to-completion","title":"Deployment should proceed to completion","text":"<p>From this point forward, deployment should proceed automatically, similar to how it would progress with a network based deployment.</p>"},{"location":"release_notes/","title":"Release notes","text":""},{"location":"release_notes/2017/12/04/recent-confluent-features/","title":"Recent Confluent Features","text":"<p>Confluent has a new discovery mechanism.

Within {} are a number of potential substitute values and operations.</p> <p>The most common operation is to extract a number from the nodename.

Additionally, {n0} is special as representing the last number in a name, so in the b1o2r3u4 example, {n0} would be 4.</p> <p>Frequently a value derives from a number in the node name, but must undergo a transform to be useful.  As an example, if we have a scheme where nodes are numbered n1-n512, and they are arranged 1-42 in rack1, 43-84 in rack2, and so forth, it is convenient to perform arithmetic on the extracted number.

Here we also had to adjust by subtracting 1 and adding it back to make the math work as expected.</p> <p>It is sometimes the case that the number must be formatted a different way, either specifying 0 padding or converting to hexadecimal.  This can be done by a number of operators at the end to indicate formatting changes.</p> <pre><code>{n1:02x} - Zero pad to two decimal places, and convert to hexadecimal, as might be used for generating MAC addresses\n{n1:x} - Hexadecimal without padding, as may be used in a generated IPv6 address\n{n1:X} - Uppercase hexadecimal\n{n1:02d} - Zero pad a normal numeric representation of the number.\n</code></pre> <p>Another common element to pull into an expression is the node name in whole:</p> <pre><code>hardwaremanagement.manager={nodename}-imm\n</code></pre> <p>Additionally other attributes may be pulled in:</p> <pre><code>net.switchport={location.u}\n</code></pre> <p>Multiple expressions are permissible within a single attribute:</p> <pre><code>hardwaremanagement.manager={nodename}-{hardwaremanagement.method}\n</code></pre> <p>A note to developers: in general the API layer will automatically recognize a generic set attribute to string with expression syntax and import it as an expression.

The enclosure.bay nodeattribute should be set to 1 for the switch installed to the left (as seen from the front of the rack) and to 2 for the switch installed in the right.
