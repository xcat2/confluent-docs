# 3.2.0 Confluent release

3.2.0 has been released with the following changes:
<!-- more -->

## Firmware updates, media, os import, and more no longer require confluent user to have access

When using the CLI client, the end user access is used when possible for
the relevant file rather than requiring the confluent user be able to open
it independently. This should largely eliminate the need to place files in
/tmp and set relaxed permissions for confluent to process them, except
when traversing a collective.

## Lenovo v2 product family is now supported

Updates have been performed to support new functions in the v2 family. Notably:
* New configurations of v2 dense chassis are supported
* `nodereseat` can now reseat rackmount servers as well as dense for v2 servers

## Ansible playbooks are now supported in OS profiles

A profile may contain ansible/post.d/, ansible/firstboot.d/, and/or ansible/onboot.d/ yaml files. If present,
then confluent will execute the plays on the management node targeted at a node reaching
that phase of deployment. The 'Hosts' line will be provided by confluent, and should be
omitted from plays in those directories.  Requires `osdeploy initialize -a`

## A syncfiles facility has been implemented

Profiles now have a `syncfiles` facility that allow files on the deployment server to be synced to servers
during the post phase:

* Implements a superset of syntax as xCAT syncfiles
* Merging passwd and group implicitly creates password disabled corresponding shadow entries as needed
* syncfiles file in a profile directory directs functionality (samples available in default profiles)
* Requires `osdeploy initialize -a`

## Confluent Genesis environment has received improvements

As well as refreshing the general lever of software contained in genesis, some key enhancements have been implemented:

* Confluent genesis may now be targeted by ansbile plays
* Console behavior is enhanced for video console when serial is in use
* Confluent now supports LVM2 drives for rescue activity

## Collective behavior has been significantly improved

A focus area during 3.2 development was studying collective behavior in very large configurations,
and addressing a number of issues:
* Improve speed of convergence of state information
* Reduce instances of 'lost' collective members missed during startup
* Better handling of long-running remote tasks to avoid false errors about collective member going unreachable

## Switch interrogation is now subject to `collective.managercandidates`

A collective may spsecify which managers are permitted to scan a switch. This can be used to speed up switch interrogation
in large clusters with multiple collective members dealing with isolated 'islands' of networking.

## Numerous performance improvements have been implemented

A significant effort was put into profiling and identifying opportunities for significant performance improvement. Notably:

* VT-aware buffering is now offloaded and rewritten in C
* SNMP switch interrogation is offloaded the main process
* nodeconfig memory consumption has been improved
* Improved discovery performance
* Web consoles are migrated to a websocket interface

## Improvements have been made to OS deployment

A number of enhancements were done for OS deployment:
* A firstboot.d script may now 'reboot' without breaking firstboot support
* Output is now more prominent on console and in /var/log/confluent
* A new `source_remote_parts` is added to let a script source, rather than run, segregated scripts that are remote.
* Some envirnonment variables have had 'confluent_' prepended, to avoid conflict with other uses of the common variable names.
* Alma, Rocky, CentOS Stream, CentOS, and RedHat are all supported through at least 8.4 version

## Confluent private SSH keys are now encrypted

The private keys are now encrypted on generation, and ssh-agent is used
to decrypt. The same protection applied to 'secret.' attributes is extended
to private ssh keys used by confluent SSH certificate authority, and the
key used for ansible execution and syncfiles operation

## Various minor enhancements and fixes have been done

A large number of minor fixes and enhancements were done. Some changes include:

* `nodesetboot` and `nodeboot` now accept `usb` as a boot device target
* `osdeploy` now has a `list` subcommand to show distributions and profiles
* `nodeshell` now has a `-s` argument to allow specifying an alternative name (e.g. `bmc-{node}`) or suffix (e.g. `-eth1`) for ssh processes
