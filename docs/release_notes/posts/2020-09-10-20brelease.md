# 3.0.4 Confluent release

There is an update to the scale out management stack, bringing xCAT to 2.16.0.lenovo1 (based on 2.16.0) and confluent is now at 3.0.4.
<!-- more -->

The major change in confluent is the addition of OS deployment support. This includes:
* Deploy to disk is implemented for RedHat/CentOS 7 and 8, SuSE Enterprise/LEAP 15.3, RHV-H 4.3/4.4, ESXi 6.7/7, and Ubuntu 20.04
* Boot over USB, as well as over PXE and HTTP/HTTPS over Ethernet, Infiniband, or Omnipath is supported
* SSH is enabled early during installations and systems may be sshed into more easily during installer execution for monitoring and debug
* HTTPS boot and install support - All installation activity may optionally be protected by HTTPS
* TLS CA management - each collective member becomes a TLS certificate authority and signs its own certificate and OS deployment has those
  authorities added
* SecureBoot support - When using HTTP boot (instead of PXE), SecureBoot may be enabled throughout the deployment process
* Encrypted OS disk - For RedHat/CentOS 8.2 and higher, encrypting the OS install disk using the TPM2 is now supported
* Built in PXE and ProxyDHCP support - Confluent may either coexist with an existing DHCP server without configuring that DHCP server or operate without any DHCP server at all
* A new genesis distribution is provided for optional use, though no longer required even for PXE driven discovery
* Partial in-band BMC configuration is available with `configbmc` facility (can configure dedicated/shared, vlan, and ip address, but user and ipmi config happens remotely)
* Autodetection of serial port parameters - No longer requires manual specification of console port and speed, it will be detected from firmware
* New SSH infrastructure strategy - SSH CA is configured and used to sign host keys to enable known_hosts and facilitate host based authentication. This eliminates any transfer or reuse of any user or host private keys, while enabling non-administrative users for node-to-node ssh without user managed keys.

When deciding whether to use xCAT or confluent for cluster setup, a [comparison]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/confluentvxcat.html) is provided.

Storage volumes with blank names can now be deleted by nodestorage.

Additionally, confluent noderanges now understand `..` (two dots) as a synonym for '-' or ':' to indicate a range of sequential systems.
