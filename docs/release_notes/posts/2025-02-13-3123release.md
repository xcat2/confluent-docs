# 3.12.3 Confluent release

3.12.3 has been released with the following changes:
<!-- more -->

## Fix for DHCP relay behavior

A regression in the DHCP relay behavior has been addressed.

## Enhanced SSH session behavior in WebGUI

SSH sessions will now persist across switching console types and tab reload

## By default disable SELinux in EL9 diskless image builds

As of EL9.5, SELinux now attempts to load a policy if enabled, and this fails boot.

## Recognize attribute aliases when clearing attribs using `nodeattrib`

When using `nodeattrib -c`, attribute short names will now be recognized (e.g. 'bmc' being short for 'hardwaremanagement.manager')

## Remote media fix

Corrected an issue where recent redfish performance enhancements would result in detach of virtual media when working with an xClarity Controller after some time

## More fixes for xClarity Controller version 3

Improved inventory handling of Infiniband adapters, more comprehensive health check for this platform

## Fix performance regression for xClarity Controller 2 and earlier with redfish

The new sensor handling code dramatically reduced performance with xClarity 2 and earlier, those platforms are now omitted from the new sensor reading code.

## Fix for rack view when dealing with manually specified node height

A regression in the new rackview is corrected for users that manually specify node height.
