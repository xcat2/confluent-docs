3.12.2 has been released with the following changes:

# The 3D view now sorts the racks in a row

Previously, the 3D view failed to sort the rack consistently with the 2D view, this has been remedied

# Improvements have been made for XCC3 and SMM3 support

The XCC3 remote video is updated for newer firmware, and general support for SMM3 redfish has been implemented

# Fix bond modes in confignet

confignet has been updated to support more of the bond modes correctly. This change requires an `osdeploy rebase` to take effect.

# Rack view updates for N1380 chassis

The rack views have been updated to support the vertical node orientation of the N1380 chassis

# Implement mechanism to filter nics for DHCP offers

/etc/confluent/service.cfg may now describe NICs to not provide PXE over IPv4 answers.

```
# cat /etc/confluent/service.cfg
[netboot]
ignorenics=enp65s0f1np1,enp65s0f3np3
```

# Improvement for multiple NICs connected to same VLAN

Netboot offers are checked for 'wrong subnet' when subnets are crossed, avoiding sending an offer on the wrong nic when a better NIC also makes an offer.

# Support longer profile names

If a profile name is longer than can fit in a DHCP offer, a shortening feature is provided. If updating, this will not function
until the httpd service is restarted.
